                <h1>Welcome to VibraWise</h1>
                <p>VibraWise is an advanced software suite engineered to tackle both nonlinear and linear vibration problems in thin plates and shells. Leveraging a broad spectrum of mathematical methodologies and theoretical frameworks, VibraWise delivers precise and reliable analysis, addressing the complexities and uncertainties involved in selecting the most suitable analytical method. The software integrates sophisticated techniques, including numerical algorithms and Finite Element Method (FEM), to offer comprehensive and accurate solutions.</p>

                <h2>About VibraWise</h2>
                <p>VibraWise was conceived during my PhD research, where the need for a versatile software tool became evident. While developing custom code for various shell configurations, it became clear that a dedicated solution was necessaryâ€”one that could automate essential calculations, facilitate comparative analysis, and recommend optimal methods for specific vibration problems.</p>

                <h2>Development Phases</h2>
                
                <h3>First Phase:</h3>
                <p>Version 0.9 introduces the following capabilities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Solving free vibration problems for cantilever cylindrical shells.</li>
                    <li>Employing pre-defined series solutions, such as Chebyshev polynomials.</li>
                    <li>Inputting and handling basis functions with corresponding coordinate systems.</li>
                    <li>Implementing a robust orthogonalization process to orthogonalize functions, whether from predefined templates or user inputs.</li>
                    <li>Automating linear analysis using FEM, including mesh selection, element suitability evaluation, and generating comparative results with graphical outputs.</li>
                    <li>Applying advanced numerical methods.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Second Phase:</h3>
                <p>Extending capabilities to solve free and forced vibration problems for shells and plates under various boundary conditions.</p>
                
                <h3>Third Phase:</h3>
                <p>Developing and integrating a training model to leverage Large Language Models (LLM) for predicting and analyzing nonlinear behavior.</p>
                
                <p>We welcome any expertise, guidance, and contributions from the community.</p>
